### What I learned

I learnt more about HTML tags parenting and how they can be styled logically using css.

Also to use flex box (flex-grow, flex-shink, flex-basis) to make web-pages responsive and require less media queries.


### Continued development

i'd like to get better at flex-box to reduce bulky media query code block.
